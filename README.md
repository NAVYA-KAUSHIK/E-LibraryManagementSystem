 E-LIBRARY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM 
____________________________________________________________ 
DESCRIPTION: 
___________________________________________________________ 
Welcome to my project! 
This is an E-Library management system made in C++ using linked lists and file and handling. 
It helps admins to enter books as well as students' information, update records, search records, delete records and finally display all records. 
The homepage guides the user to enter the two modules (BOOK and STUDENT). 
The module menu pages have an index to further guide the user.  
____________________________________________________________________ 
LIMITATIONS: 
___________________________________________________________________  
The project handles information temporarily during the moduleâ€™s runtime without storing it permanently.
As soon as module page is exited, the information gets lost even if you go back to the module during the same runtime.
